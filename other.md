# Other/Misc.

Welcome to this web space! It's meant to be filled with knick-knacks of thoughts and miscellaneous things I find odd and fascinating!

My name is Grace, born in Montreal, grew up in Vancouver, and now living in Toronto. Currently, I am a PhD student in experimental psychology and this part of my webpage is just another manifestation of my chronic procrastination.

Most, if not all the time, I really don't know what I am doing, but I am determined to create, discover, and collect little things I enjoy and find fascinating. There is no specific goal for this space and it would likely be filled with a few personal topics of interest, accompanied by my occasional illustrations.

So if you'd like, please join me on this journey of procrastination on big, scary pending deadlines, and explore and appreciate the small things together!
